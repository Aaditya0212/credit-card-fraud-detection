# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project focused on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using classification models and advanced data balancing techniques. Built with real-world imbalanced data, this project demonstrates proficiency in model evaluation, feature engineering, and business-aware data science practices.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

- Built binary classification models to predict fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.
- Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to address class imbalance.
- Compared **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** using evaluation metrics relevant to fraud detection (Recall, Precision, F1-score).
- Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on anonymized transaction data.
- Achieved a recall of **84.5%** using Random Forest â€” critical for minimizing false negatives in fraud detection scenarios.

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression| 99.2%    | 87.1%     | 76.3%  | 81.3%    |
| Random Forest       | **99.6%**| **91.7%** | **84.5%**| **88.0%** |

> ðŸŽ¯ Focused on **Recall** and **Precision** to reflect the business need of minimizing false negatives (missed fraud cases).
